# FlooringPlanner
For visualizing hardwood flooring joint stagger and waste minimization with various cutting options.  

Dragging the three sliders sets the cut length (as a fractional percentage from 0.0-1.0) of the first board of the first three rows.  The remainder after cutting the last board in the row is used to start the next row (in the same sequence).  The reverse option makes the first cut the right-most board in the row instead of the left (and makes diagonal hatches for the board color).  Red boards are below the desired minimum board length.
